# 📅 Resource Scheduling App

A mobile application built with **Flutter** that simulates **CPU scheduling algorithms** (FCFS, SJF, Priority – non-preemptive) in the context of **resource booking**.  
The app allows users to request organizational resources (e.g., rooms, laptops, chairs) and schedules them efficiently based on the chosen algorithm.
